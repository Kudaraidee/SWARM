# SWARM 3.5.6

## Improvements
* Uses miniz cuda 11 version now.
* Fixed link for teamredminer linux version.
* SWARM will now wipe dead screens on startup. (linux)

## Note
* I am aware of nanominer issues. I am still trying to address them. Just uploading fixes I have made thus far.
* I am also aware that tt-miner and lolminer have updates as well. I need to test them first.
