# Version 3.5.8

## Alpha Release
* This project is in a restoration period- I am trying to get it to full working status.

## Known Working Items
* Nvidia miners and using different NVIDIA groups is working.
* CPU miners are working, but some miners use a lot of RAM- May be issue when using with GPU miners.
* Removed depreciatied arguments, listed them as [depreciatied] in the SWARM helper script. Will remove altogether later.
* HiveOS ready- Tested on latest HiveOS version, but HiveOS beta is HIGHLY reccommended.
* Windows ready- Tested on Windows 10 and 11 and was working, including most HiveOS features.
* I HAVE NOT tested on a generic Unix machine, and am in the process of building one for support.

## Improvements 
* All miners that are in the current lineup is updated to latest version.
* Cuda libs updated to Cuda 11.6...Cuda 11.5 and 11.6 are supported.
* Fixed ``get stats`` command to shorthand algo-miner combinations to better display on screen.
* Added 10+ new algorithms.
* Powershell and other apps will be installed/updated.

## KNOWN ISSUES
* ``Get Wallets`` not working.
* Bminer has issues on nicehash pool.
* More miners are coming soon- Not a lot of choices atm.
* Swapping GPUs in Windows between differen PCI slots may cause incorrect Windows Registry data for GPUS. Solutions for fixes are being explored.
* Combining AMD and NVIDIA was not tested/not supported atm, but will be soon.
* Some pools used in -Poolname are depreciated, check to see if they exist before using.

## Suggested Settings- What I as the Dev use.
* -Auto_Coin Yes (use coin for calculations when applicable)
* -Stat_Coin live (Mine based on individual coin statistics live values)
* -Stat_Algo Live (Use live data for algorithms)
* -Min_Blocks 4 (Don't mine anything that is going to take more than 6 hours to find)
* -historical_bias 1:1 (Don't penalize based on historical data- Too much new activity now)
* -Hashrate_Threshold 10 (Don't switch miner on same algorithm unless it falls below 10% hashrate of next best miner)
* -Switch_Threshold 5 (Don't switch unless next profitable item is at least 5% better)
