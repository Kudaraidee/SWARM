# Version 3.6.2

## Beta Release
* This project has all basic miners, but need more miners and updates.

## Important Note!
* AMD requires clinfo installed. HiveOS beta does not have it. `apt-get install clinfo` will install it in linux. (may need `apt update` first)
* If the above is too confusing, use -Opencl [AMD Platform] if you know what platform AMD is.

## Improvements 
* xmrig added- Having issues getting random algos to work on Gpu. See discord.
* gminer updated
* wildrig update
* t-rex update
* lib64 is now downloaded, not stored in release
* All Cuda libs from 8.0 to 11.6 are now in SWARM
* zpool -auto_coin improved
* sha256cms algo support added

## KNOWN ISSUES
* Get Wallets not working.
* More miners are coming soon.

## Suggested Settings- What I as the Dev use.
* -Auto_Coin Yes (use coin for calculations when applicable)
* -Stat_Coin live (Mine based on individual coin statistics live values)
* -Stat_Algo Live (Use live data for algorithms)
* -Min_Blocks 4 (Don't mine anything that is going to take more than 6 hours to find)
* -historical_bias 1:1 (Don't penalize based on historical data- Too much new activity now)
* -Hashrate_Threshold 10 (Don't switch miner on same algorithm unless it falls below 10% hashrate of next best miner)
* -Switch_Threshold 5 (Don't switch unless next profitable item is at least 5% better)
