# Version 3.6.7

## Beta Release
* This project has all basic miners, but need more miners and updates.

## Important Note!
* Lolminer has changed to lolminer-a on AMD. Your config lolminer.json will be deleted on update.
* Miniz has changed to miniz-n on NVIDIA. Your config miniz.json will be deleted on update.
* These changes were done for log updates. One time change only.
* Since name of miner in SWARM has changed, SWARM will bench them again.

## Improvements 
* Logging changes, see new readme in logs folder or read issue on github. #395
* `-Conserve` will now switch to oc for algo SHA256 so you can set an idle OC for SHA256
* Miners Updated. #424
* Miniz added for amd, but made optional using -Optional argument. Works on only certain gpus.

## KNOWN ISSUES
* Get Wallets not working.
* More miners are coming soon.
* User reported issue with AMD ryzen cpu & SWARM- If you have issue please report in discord.

## Suggested Settings- What I as the Dev use.
* -Auto_Coin Yes (use coin for calculations when applicable)
* -Stat_Coin Hour_EMA (Mine based on individual coin statistics hourly values)
* -Stat_Algo Hour_EMA (Use hourly data for algorithms)
* -Min_Blocks 4 (Don't mine anything that is going to take more than 6 hours to find)
* -historical_bias 1:1 (Don't penalize based on historical data- Too much new activity now)
* -Hashrate_Threshold 10 (Don't switch miner on same algorithm unless it falls below 10% hashrate of next best miner)
* -Switch_Threshold 5 (Don't switch unless next profitable item is at least 5% better)
