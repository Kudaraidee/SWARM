* -Stat_Coin live (Mine based on individual coin statistics live values)
* -Stat_Algo Live (Use live data for algorithms)
* -Min_Blocks 4 (Don't mine anything that is going to take more than 6 hours to find)
* -historical_bias 1:1 (Don't penalize based on historical data- Too much new activity now)
* -Hashrate_Threshold 10 (Don't switch miner on same algorithm unless it falls below 10% hashrate of next best miner)
* -Switch_Threshold 5 (Don't switch unless next profitable item is at least 5% better)
