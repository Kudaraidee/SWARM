# SWARM 3.5.3

## What's New?
* Added mining pool hub pool. (-Poolname mph). I found there was issues with certain algorithms- Pool side.
* Added argument -MPH_User, which is username for Mining Pool Hub

## Improvements
* Replaced cuda 10.2 miner with cuda 11.1 miners (where possible, I still need to recompile a lot of miners)
* Bans should now do -Bans [Coin]:[Pool] correctly for -Auto_Coin Yes 
* Claymore moved to optional miners. See -optional argument if you wish to still use.
