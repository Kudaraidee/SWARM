# Version 3.5.9

## Alpha Release
* This project is in a restoration period- I am trying to get it to full working status.

## Improvements 
* Wildrig updated.
* Mike algo for GPU added.
* Teamredminer added for Amd (Only does algorithms it supports on all gpus)
* Bminer abandonded- Too many reported issues.
* Autolykos for nicehash fixed.
* -Conserve will tag miner when it is not mining "Conserve".
* EUID error fixed.
* yescrypt was named to cyescrypt to prevent issues.

## KNOWN ISSUES
* Get Wallets not working.
* More miners are coming soon.

## Suggested Settings- What I as the Dev use.
* -Auto_Coin Yes (use coin for calculations when applicable)
* -Stat_Coin live (Mine based on individual coin statistics live values)
* -Stat_Algo Live (Use live data for algorithms)
* -Min_Blocks 4 (Don't mine anything that is going to take more than 6 hours to find)
* -historical_bias 1:1 (Don't penalize based on historical data- Too much new activity now)
* -Hashrate_Threshold 10 (Don't switch miner on same algorithm unless it falls below 10% hashrate of next best miner)
* -Switch_Threshold 5 (Don't switch unless next profitable item is at least 5% better)
